# My Beloved Adi.,

Happy 16th Birthday.

I know that i havent been the perfect boyfriend that you would always ask for, i know that ive been really troublesome lately and ive been such a hassle to deal with.. and there's been so many reasons thats wrong with me lately but you still choose to stay. im sorry i wasnt the first one to greet you happy birthday..

I tried my best with this and thank you for everything.. its currently 2:49 am and my brain is not working problem with all this program stuff ahae. for now this is the simplest thing i can do and im sorry but i promise to you ill make it up to you in the future. i hope and really wish that you would always stay happy and no problems will ever make you suffer. i will always be here watching over you if you ever do so encounter those problems..

happy birthday and im always wishing the best for you<3 and you should also take more better care of yourself while im not there ha.. i love you so much i dont even know how to express it anymore.. thank you for always bearing with me no matter how complicated ive been. 

Always Yours,

- Iel.
